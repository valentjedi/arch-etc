# My Arch Linux system settings files
This repo contains settings file for my Arch Linux installation.  
It consists of two parts:
* First part is settings for Macbook Pro mid-2015 (11,5). Check [mbp](https://github.com/valignatev/arch-etc/releases/tag/mbp) git tag for Arch on macbook settings I used
* Second part is settings for my current laptop which is Lenovo ThinkPad T480s. All commits after [mbp](https://github.com/valignatev/arch-etc/releases/tag/mbp) git tag will be related to it.

## Usage
I don't recommend cloning this repo directly into your `/etc` directory.  
Instead, copy needed file contents and paste it on your machine.
